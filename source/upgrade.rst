Upgrading
=========

If you installed bargate using Git you can simply 'git pull' to the latest::

  git pull

bargate uses git branches to enable you to upgrade only within a major release 
of bargate. To upgrade to a later major release you will need to switch branches::

  git checkout <branch-name>

At time of writing the branches available are:

- 1.4
- 1.3
